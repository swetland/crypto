Some simple crypto tools focused on RSA signing and verification.

This is an exercise in learning a bit more about how this stuff works.

WARNING: This is very much a work in progress and you'd probably be
wiser using more mature code from openssl's libcrypto or some other
existing crypto library.

WARNING: This code is not hardened against timing attacks and does
not practice any paranoia in handling key matter.  I'd advise against
using it for anything but verification.

Most of this code is original, but these pieces come from other projects:

imath.[ch] from http://spinning-yarns.org/michael/sw/imath/

sha1.[ch] from http://android.git.kernel.org/platform/system/core.git
